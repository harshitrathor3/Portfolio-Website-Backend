API - 
    home/hit_count

    Firstly try to use ORM (previously worked with CRUD operation by wiritng queries) - done
    tried to make the API async - failed
    explored why failed than found that the CRUD operation should also be asynced if API needs to be async
    Made the CRUD operation async - done (learned new thing)
    async performance is not good because reading and writing the same database row is creating lot of conflicts.
    ask chatgpt and found that an update operation (instead of read than write) can be lot optimized.
    async performanceis improved - (worked for 50 users handling 10 users per second)
    while testing it for 100 users, got 70% failure rate, bcz everytime max connection pool exceeding for that database
    resolved that by setting up the max_connection pool as 5, but the average response time was increased to 9.5 seconds.
